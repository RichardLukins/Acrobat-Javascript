Acrobat-Javascript
==================

Javascript enhancements for Adobe Acrobat (not Reader). 
Initially these utilities were needed for book scanning, with enhanced productivity to help split pages and rotation, combining files etc.

But Happy for any other tools to join the archive here, as there seems to be little in the way of central storage of things like this.

Please feel free to email me any questions, and any bugs or issues.
thanks
Richard
