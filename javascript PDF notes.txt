exportAsText
Exports form fields as a tab-delimited text file to a local hard disk. The text file that is created follows the conventions specified by Microsoft Excel. In particular, exportAsText correctly handles quotes and multiline text fields.
This method writes two lines to the text file, the first line is a tab-delimited list of the names of the fields specified by aFields, the second line is a tab-delimited list of the values of the fields.
Note:If the cPath parameter is specified, this method can only be executed during a batch or console event. See also “Privileged versus non-privileged context” on page 32. The event object includes a discussion of JavaScript events.
Parameters
6.0
S
F
bNoPassword
(optional) If true (the default), do not include text fields that have the password flag set in the exported text file.
aFields
(optional) The array of field names to submit or a string containing a single field name:
●If specified, only these fields are exported, except those excluded by bNoPassword.
●If aFields is an empty array, no fields are exported.
●If this parameter is omitted or is null, all fields in the form are exported, except those excluded by bNoPassword.
cPath
(optional) A string specifying the device-independent path for the file. The path may be relative to the location of the current document. If the parameter is omitted, a dialog box is shown to let the user select the file.
Note:The parameter cPath is must have a safe path (see “Safe path” on page 31) and have a .txt extension. This method will throw a NotAllowedError (see Error object) exception if these security conditions are not met, and the method will fail.
Example
To export all fields to a tab-delimited file, execute the following script in the console:
this.exportAsText();
To create a tab-delimited file with more than just one data line, see the “Example” on page 300.
