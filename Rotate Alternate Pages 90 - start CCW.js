// JavaScript Utilities for Adobe Acrobat (NOT Reader) tested on V8 of Acrobat Pro, should work at least up to V11
// 
// Code and Ideas have been borrowed from many sources, these are listed where possible at the end of the Code
// 
// Each script can be saved with a .js extension to the javascript directory
// ie "C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 8.0\Acrobat\Javascripts" on a Windows Vista/7/8 64 bit install for V8.0
// you must restart Acrobat after copying to see the menu options change
// All these utilities are added to the "Edit" Menu
// to disbale them, remove from the Javascript directory and restart Acrobat
// Each utility is stand alone, so you can just save each utility as needed
// You can insert the contents of multiple utilities into a single file, although I prefer to keep them separate for ease of editing
//
// Lastly I Have included lots of comments to make any modification easier to facilitate
// No warranty is given as to operation, and you accept all risks of using this code
// Backup files before modifying them in case of unexpected results or system crashes

// Add a menu item to collate with another document on the filesystem
